Note: 	cockpit and tailscale have been installed to make accessing the system easier.
	This might have influenced some answers.

Q1. 	The base system uses about 2,5 GB (after installing cockpit and tailscale)

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
dev             674M     0  674M   0% /dev
run             935M  868K  934M   1% /run
/dev/mmcblk0p2   15G  2.5G   11G  19% /
tmpfs           935M     0  935M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           935M  4.0K  935M   1% /tmp
/dev/mmcblk0p1  511M   42M  470M   9% /boot
tmpfs           187M  4.0K  187M   1% /run/user/1001
tmpfs           187M  4.0K  187M   1% /run/user/1000


Q2. 	The flag -h makes the output human readable, translating bytes to MB and GB.

Q3. 	The base system uses 165 Mi.

Q4. 	Listing explicitly installed packages can be done with: 'pacman -Qqe'.
	Use grep to find a specific package. E.g. 'pacman -Qqe | grep linux'

Q5.	git version 2.44.0

Q6.	See output below for commit history:
